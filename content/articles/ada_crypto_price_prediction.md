## Strong foundations

Once again, Cardano strength has been proven to be its loyal community of both fans and hard working veteran developers. During the price crash of mid September 2021 Cardano has shown that it´s social interest in Twitter Telegram and Youtube has not declined at all.

Based on the data from _[coinsocialmedia.com](https://coinsocialmedia.com/coins/cardano/)_, we can find a few interesting price prediction metrics:

### Youtube Video Views to market cap ratio

As of today, ADA holds roughly 82 Views per Million Dollar Marketcap, which is considerably much higher than it´s main competitor, Eth, with only 17 Youtube Views per Million Dollar MarketCap.

### Youtube Video creators subscribers to market cap ratio

On the other hand, the video creators (aka youtubers) creating content about ADA put on the table 5,856,538 subscribers. That is a lot. To put things in perspective, youtubers making videos about Bitcoin currently sum a total of 8,521,466 subscribers.
