## Strong foundations

Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies tumbled on Monday amid a global selloff of risky assets. The drop appears to have been triggered by mounting problems at real estate giant China Evergrande Group. Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, was down 7% on Monday to around $ 43,000. Ethereum, the second largest cryptocurrency, is down 8% to around $ 3,100. Smaller coins also saw declines, including Cardano, Binance, XRP, Solana, and Polkadot, the latter discounting 13% at $ 29.47.

Currently, there is no direct connection between Evergrande and the cryptocurrency world. This seems to be a case of widespread risk aversion, and investors have cashed in one after another.

But this is how Evergrande’s troubles may spread to the cryptocurrency market.

On the one hand, financial shock waves often quickly hit the cryptocurrency market, partly because they never stop trading-investors can buy and sell cryptocurrencies 24/7 on multiple global exchanges and decentralized trading platforms.

Cryptocurrencies are also generally regarded as speculative investments, not just for basic reasons. Traders tend to buy and sell based on momentum signals and use derivatives to gain exposure, and they may exit quickly when there is a problem for the first time.

"Once the Chinese stock market closes, many people may sell cryptocurrencies to raise cash," said Stephane Ouellette, CEO of FRNT Financial, a Toronto-based crypto derivatives company. "We observed the correlation with cryptocurrencies during the mass sell-off, and you tend to see it a few hours later; they put their legs down."

If China's commercial paper market starts to become turbulent, stablecoin issuers may also be in trouble. Tether, the world's largest stablecoin, said last week that it does not hold any securities issued by Evergrande.

But this does not reassure some crypto analysts, who pointed out that Evergrande supports approximately $300 billion in debt, which is distributed among many banks and other financial companies. The default may affect China's commercial paper and short-term securities markets, as well as stable currency reserves.

In a statement to Barron’s, Tether stated that it “has a strong, liquid and conservative investment portfolio with a focus on protecting our reserves. The vast majority of commercial paper held by Tether is A-2 and above. The issuer of the rating."

The company added that it will not disclose counterparties because "we are engaged in commercially sensitive business" and we "must respect their privacy."

Some analysts say that the impact of China's commercial paper crash on other industries goes far beyond stable currencies. "I think pension plans will be more affected," Ouellette said. "Stablecoins hold a considerable portion of their assets in legal tender. Compared with Tether, Chinese banks have much more trouble in the collapse of the paper industry."

Even if stablecoins do not "break money", traders in Asia may liquidate cryptocurrencies to raise cash, in anticipation of more declines. Many traders use leverage to gain exposure; as prices fall, they may face a margin call, forcing them to liquidate their positions, or their positions may be automatically liquidated by the exchange.

Compared with institutional investors in the United States or Europe, institutional investors in Asia are more likely to have access to cryptocurrencies. A recent survey by Fidelity Digital Assets shows that more than 70% of institutional investors in Asia have allocated digital assets, compared to 56% in Europe and 33% in the United States. These figures have risen sharply from 2020.

From a technical point of view, Bitcoin itself now looks very unstable. DailyFx.com technical strategist Michael Boutros (Michael Boutros) said that the fall into the $44,000 range broke the multi-month technical uptrend. Even if it rises to $47,000, it must close a little higher to break through the technical resistance at that level.

"As long as the price is less than $47,000, the risk will be lower," he said. The next purchase price is $41,900. If it drops to $38,777, it will be an "annual purchase."

Boutros said that another caveat is that the technical side of Bitcoin looks similar to the S&P 500 index, which also broke through support.

If a wave of contagion sweeps the financial markets, cryptocurrencies may face the most severe test in years. So far, they have all failed.
