## Crossing paths

My journey in the crypto world started at a poker table. One good day I went for a casual game in a northern German city, and there, sitting in the game I met Manuel -who would later become good friend-.

Manuel would look at me, and after a few words exchange, he started to explain me about this new jewel that he had discovered: STEEM, the new revolutionary blockchain-based social media platform.

Back then, I was highly disappointed with the social media status quo, and the idea of a decentralized, self governed and economically incentivized social media platform was really exciting.

After some initial research and investigation, I went 100% all in for it. I started working a lot on my web development skills and soon enough, I was pretty much working full time as a dApp developer in this platform.
